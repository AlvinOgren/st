I am a self-employed consultant with a master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering and 24 years of experience as a full-stack developer, front-end developer and software architect.

In the projects I have been involved in I have worked with all phases, from requirements to tests and deployments, as well as built all parts of the systems including back-ends and databases, but the focus has been on front-end development in recent years. I have mainly worked as a senior developer and built new systems where I have driven the development of architecture, technical platforms and frameworks, and supported my colleagues.

I'm available for new assignments from April 1st.
